              Hi! I am a first-year student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, 
              pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. I 
              am a highly motivated student taking a heavier course load to achieve 
              my goal of graduating three semesters early in January 2024. My plans, 
              however, could change based on internship and/or co-op opportunities 
              during the fall and spring semester. Currently, I am looking for 
              internships in Software Engineering to develop my programming 
              skills and better understand industry practices. I hope to work as a 
              Machine Learning Engineer or Software Developer with a focus on AI in 
              the future. I plan to take more courses in the field of Artificial 
              Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning during the next two 
              years and higher-level math courses to obtain an in-depth understanding 
              of these disciplines. I am currently looking for internships in Software 
              Engineering to develop my programming skills and better understand 
              industry practices. Please feel free to reach out to me! My contact 
              information is availible on my 
              <a class = "match-text" href="contact.html">Contacts and Socials</a>
